Description: A virtual library of UQ test functions and a method to create reproducible simulation studies for comparing emulators. The package is meant to provide a consistent way to call common UQ test functions without needing to repeatedly look up input ranges and function definitions. It also provides a mechanism for simulation study which allows emulators to be compared even across different papers.
