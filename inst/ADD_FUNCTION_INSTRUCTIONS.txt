When adding a new function to this package, take the following steps.

1. Add a new file to the R folder
2. Write the new function.
      a. The first argument must be a vector of inputs called x.
      b. The second argument must be called scale01 (even if not used).
	- The intent of scale01 is that inputs can be passed in on a (0, 1) scale
	  and scaling of the inputs is done internally (for scale01=TRUE)
      c. Additional arguments are allowed but must be optional
3. Document the function
      a. Try to be as consistent as possible with previous documentation
4. In the same file, add a private function called quackquack_<FUNCTION_NAME>. This
   function should return a named list with fields (in this order)
      a. input_dim - the number of input dimensions
      b. input_cat - logical. Does the function have categorical inputs?
      c. response_type - a member of the set c("uni", "multi", "func")
      d. a px2 matrix of ranges for each input
        NOTE: if the ranges are not (0, 1), the function should internally change the input
        values when scale01 is TRUE
5. In the quackquack.R file, add the function and its info to the master list.
