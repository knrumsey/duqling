### Description 

The `duqling` R package contains a wide variety of test functions for UQ. The goal of `duqling` is to facilitate reproducible UQ research by providing a large number of test functions, datasets, and automated simulation studies. The main functionality of `duqling` includes.

   1. A large library of test functions (see `quack()` function) with consistent usage and (optional) internal scaling which allows for inputs to be generated on the unit hyper-rectangle.
   2. A large library of UQ datasets (see `data_quack()` function) which are stored in the affiliated [UQDataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/UQdataverse/).
   3. Automated simulation studies for emulation (see `run_sim_study()` for test functions and `run_sim_study_data()` for datasets) which internally generates unique random seeds, allowing for direct comparison of results across papers and time. 


## Installation

To install the `duqling` package, type

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/duqling")
library(duqling)
```

## Functions Included in Test Library

A master list of all functions found in the `duqling` package can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::quack()
```

A list of all functions meeting certain criterion can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::quack(input_dim=4:7, stochastic="n")
```

A detailed description of each function (the `borehole()` function, for example) can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::quack("borehole")

```

## Using The Package

Every function in the `duqling` package will (optionally) perform internal scaling so that inputs can be passed on a $(0, 1)$ scale for simplicity. This internal scaling is turned on by setting the argument `scale01=TRUE`. See help files for each individual function for details. 

```{R}
n <- 100
p <- 8
X <- matrix(runif(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p)

# This is how duqling functions are generally called
y <- duqling::duq(X, "borehole")

# Or equivalently
y <- apply(X, 1, duqling::borehole, scale01=TRUE) 
```

## Reproducible Simulation Studies

To execute a reproducible simulation study, simply write two functions `my_fit()` and `my_pred()` (or lump them both into one function) and call the `run_sim_study()` function with your desired settings. Here's an example using the `BASS` package. 

If both `my_fit()` and `my_pred()` are given, the package will time these steps separately. 
```{R, eval=FALSE}
library(BASS)
#' This function should take arguments
#'    X_train
#'    y_train 
#' and return a fitted model
my_fit <- function(X, y){
  bass(X, y, h1=4, h2=40/nrow(X), verbose=FALSE)
}
```

The value returned by the `my_pred()` function depends on whether interval estimation is desired. If so, `interval = TRUE`, then the function should return a matrix with three columns representing (1) point predictions (2) lower bound of interval estimate and (3) upper bound of interval estimate. If `interval = FALSE`, then the function can return only the first column (or a numeric vector). 

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#' This function should take arguments
#'    fitted_obj
#'    X_test
#'    conf_level (only if interval = TRUE) 
#' and return a matrix of predictions (see above for details)
my_pred <- function(obj, X_test, conf_level=0.95){
  alpha <- 1 - conf_level
  preds <- predict(obj, Xt)
  
  # Get point prediction
  yhat <- apply(preds, 2, mean)
  
  # Get uncertainty
  sd <- sqrt(apply(preds, 2, var) + mean(obj$s2)) 
  
  # Make matrix to be returned
  res <- cbind(yhat,          # Point estimate
               yhat - 2*sd,   # Lower bound
               yhat + 2*sd)   # Upper bound
  
  return(res)
}
```

Alternatively, everything can be lumped into the `my_fit()` function, but only the total time (for fitting and prediction) will be computed. Here's an example with the `BART` package. 

```{R, eval =FALSE}
library(BART)
my_fit <- function(X_train, y_train, X_test, conf_level=0.95){
  mod <- wbart(X_train, y_train, X_test)
  yhat <- mod$yhat.test
  sd_post_mean <- apply(mod$yhat.test, 2, sd)
  sd_post_eps  <- mean(mod$sigma)
  sd <- sqrt(sd_post_mean^2 + sd_post_eps^2)
  cbind(yhat,
        yhat - 2*sd,
        yhat + 2*sd)
}

my_pred <- NULL
```

## Simulation Study Settings
When `run_sim_study` is called, each combination of the following arguments will be run for `replications` replications.

   - `fnames`: a vector of functions to test on. Should be a subset of `quack(input_cat=FALSE, stochastic="n", response_type="uni")$fname`.
   - `n_train`: a vector of sample sizes.
   - `NSR`: Noise to Signal ratio. The inverse of the more-standard SNR. 
   - `design_type`: What type of designs should be generated. Options are "LHS" (maximin when $n\leq 2000$, random otherwise), "grid" and "uniform". 
   
   
An example call would be
```{R, eval=FALSE}
results <- run_sim_study(my_fit, my_pred,
                         fnames = c("dms_additive", "borehole", "welch20"),
                         interval = TRUE,
                         n_train = c(100, 500),
                         NSR = c(0, 1/5),
                         design_type = "LHS",
                         replications = 5)
```

Some suggested function vectors for simulation studies are included in the functions

```{R, eval=FALSE}
get_sim_functions_full()     #31 functions
get_sim_functions_medium()   #20 functions
get_sim_functions_short()    #10 functions
get_sim_functions_tiny()     #4  functions
get_sim_functions_2d()       #12 functions
```


## Datasets and duqling

All data sets are hosted at our affiliated [UQDataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/UQdataverse/). For a full list of the unprocessed datasets, type
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::data_quack(raw=TRUE)
```

Some datasets have been processed for univariate emulation. These can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::data_quack()
```

Raw datasets can be read (via the internet) with the function `get_UQ_data()` and the processed data with the function `get_emulation_data()`. For example,
```{R, eval=FALSE}
data <- duqling::get_UQ_data("strontium_plume")

data <- duqling::get_emulation_data("strontium_plume_p4b")
X <- data$X
y <- data$y
```

Akin to the `run_sim_study()` function, automated simulation studies can be run with cross-validation using the datasets in duqling. See the previous section on simulation studies for details. 
```{R, eval=FALSE}
results <- run_sim_study_data(my_fit, my_pred,
                dnames=c("pbx9501_gold", "strontium_plume_p104"),
                folds=c(5, 10))
```
