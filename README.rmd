### Description 

The `duqling` R package contains a wide variety of test functions for UQ. The goal of `duqling` is to facilitate reproducible UQ research by providing a large number of popular test functions which

   1. Can be called quickly and easily in the exact same manner every time
   2. Allow for inputs to be generated on the unit hyper-rectangel. All `duqling` functions have (optional) internal scaling.
   
Additionally, the package provides a `run_simulation_study()` function which makes it easy to perform simulation studies for emulators (or non-linear regressors). This package makes it easier than ever to compare the performance on methods, even across papers! 

## Installation

To install the `duqling` package, type

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/duqling")
library(duqling)
```

## Functions Included in Test Library

A master list of all functions found in the `duqling` package can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::quack()
```

A list of all functions meeting certain criterion can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::quack(input_dims=4:7, stochastic="n")
```

A detailed description of each function (the `borehole()` function, for example) can be found with the command
```{R, eval=TRUE}
duqling::quack("borehole")

```

## Using The Package

Every function in the `duqling` package will (optionally) perform internal scaling so that inputs can be passed on a $(0, 1)$ scale for simplicity. This internal scaling is turned on by setting the argument `scale01=TRUE`. See help files for each individual function for details. 

```{R}
n <- 100
p <- 8
X <- matrix(runif(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p)

# This is how duqling functions are generally called
y <- apply(X, 1, 
           duqling::borehole) # scale01 = TRUE, by default

```

## Reproducible Simulation Studies

To execute a reproducible simulation study, simply write two functions `my_fit()` and `my_pred()` (or lump them both into one function) and call the `run_sim_study()` function with your desired settings. Here's an example using the `BASS` package. 

If both `my_fit()` and `my_pred()` are given, the package will time these steps separately. 
```{R, eval=FALSE}
library(BASS)
#' This function should take arguments
#'    X_train
#'    y_train 
#' and return a fitted model
my_fit <- function(X, y){
  bass(X, y, h1=4, h2=40/nrow(X), verbose=FALSE)
}
```

The value returned by the `my_pred()` function depends on whether interval estimation is desired. If so, `interval = TRUE`, then the function should return a matrix with three columns representing (1) point predictions (2) lower bound of interval estimate and (3) upper bound of interval estimate. If `interval = FALSE`, then the function can return only the first column (or a numeric vector). 

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#' This function should take arguments
#'    fitted_obj
#'    X_test
#'    conf_level (only if interval = TRUE) 
#' and return a matrix of predictions (see above for details)
my_pred <- function(obj, X_test, conf_level=0.95){
  alpha <- 1 - conf_level
  preds <- predict(obj, Xt)
  
  # Get point prediction
  yhat <- apply(preds, 2, mean)
  
  # Get uncertainty
  sd <- sqrt(apply(preds, 2, var) + mean(obj$s2)) 
  
  # Make matrix to be returned
  res <- cbind(yhat,          # Point estimate
               yhat - 2*sd,   # Lower bound
               yhat + 2*sd)   # Upper bound
  
  return(res)
}
```

Alternatively, everything can be lumped into the `my_fit()` function, but only the total time (for fitting and prediction) will be computed. Here's an example with the `BART` package. 

```{R, eval =FALSE}
library(BART)
my_fit <- function(X_train, y_train, X_test, conf_level=0.95){
  mod <- wbart(X_train, y_train, X_test)
  yhat <- mod$yhat.test
  sd_post_mean <- apply(mod$yhat.test, 2, sd)
  sd_post_eps  <- mean(mod$sigma)
  sd <- sqrt(sd_post_mean^2 + sd_post_eps^2)
  cbind(yhat,
        yhat - 2*sd,
        yhat + 2*sd)
}

my_pred <- NULL
```

## Simulation Study Settings
When `run_sim_study` is called, each combination of the following arguments will be run for `replications` replications.

   - `fnames`: a vector of functions to test on. Should be a subset of `quack(input_cat=FALSE, stochastic="n", response_type="uni")$fname`.
   - `n_train`: a vector of sample sizes.
   - `NSR`: Noise to Signal ratio. The inverse of the more-standard SNR. 
   - `design_type`: What type of designs should be generated. Options are "LHS" (maximin when $n\leq 2000$, random otherwise), "grid" and "uniform". 
   
   
An example call would be
```{R, eval=FALSE}
my_data <- run_sim_study(my_fit, my_pred,
                         fnames = c("dms_additive", "borehole", "welch20"),
                         interval = TRUE,
                         n_train = c(100, 500),
                         NSR = c(0, 1/5),
                         design_type = "LHS",
                         replications = 5)
```

Some suggested function vectors for simulation studies are included in the functions

```{R, eval=FALSE}
get_sim_functions_full()     #31 functions
get_sim_functions_medium()   #20 functions
get_sim_functions_short()    #10 functions
get_sim_functions_tiny()     #4  functions
get_sim_functions_2d()       #12 functions

```


### To Do List

   1. Add rigorous argument handling.
   2. Add functions to assess performance
   3. Run/store results of a simulation study
