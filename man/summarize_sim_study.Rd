\title{Summarize Emulator Performance from a Simulation Study}
\usage{
summarize_sim_study(
  df,
  group_by = NULL,
  methods = NULL,
  topX = 5,
  good_enough_pct = 0.01,
  fvu_thresh = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame returned by \code{run_sim_study()}, containing emulator performance metrics across simulation scenarios.}

\item{group_by}{Optional. A character vector of column names to group summaries by (e.g., \code{"fname"}, \code{"NSR"}, \code{"n_train"}, \code{"design_type"} or (rarely of interest) \code{"replication"}).}

\item{methods}{Optional. A character vector specifying a subset of methods to include in the summary.}

\item{topX}{Integer. The number of top-performing methods (by CRPS) used to compute the \code{topX_rate}. Default is 5.}

\item{good_enough_pct}{Numeric. The threshold (as a proportion above the best CRPS) to define a "good enough" emulator. Default is 0.01 (i.e., within 1\% of best).}

\item{fvu_thresh}{Numeric. The largest value of fraction of variance unexplained that is acceptable.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row corresponds to a unique emulator method and contains the following columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{method}: The method name.
    \item \code{n_scenarios}: Number of simulation scenarios in which the method was evaluated (excluding failures).
    \item \code{avg_CRPS}: Average CRPS across all valid simulation scenarios.
    \item \code{avg_RMSE}: Average RMSE across all valid simulation scenarios.
    \item \code{avg_time}: Average total time (\code{t_tot}) in seconds.
    \item \code{avg_rank_CRPS}: Average rank of the method based on CRPS within each scenario.
    \item \code{win_rate}: Proportion of scenarios where the method achieved the best CRPS.
    \item \code{topX_rate}: Proportion of scenarios where the method ranked in the top \code{X} by CRPS.
    \item \code{failure_rate}: Proportion of all runs in which the method failed (either at fitting or prediction).
    \item \code{good_enough_rate}: Proportion of scenarios where the method's CRPS was within \code{(1 + good_enough_pct)} of the best.
    \item \code{rel_CRPS}: Average CRPS relative to the best method in each scenario.
    \item \code{rel_RMSE}: Average RMSE relative to the best method in each scenario.

\description{
Computes summary statistics from the output of \code{run_sim_study()}.
}
\details{
This function summarizes emulator performance across all simulation scenarios in a \code{run_sim_study()} output. Each scenario is defined by the combination of test function, training set size, noise-to-signal ratio, design type, and replication index. Failures are excluded from accuracy and timing metrics but included in failure rate calculation.
