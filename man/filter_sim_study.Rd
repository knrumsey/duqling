\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{duq_sim_study} object from \code{process_sim_study()}.}

\item{ids}{Character vector of IDs to keep (matches \code{id}).}

\item{methods}{Character vector of methods to keep (matches \code{method}).}

\item{n_train}{Numeric vector of training sizes to keep.}

\item{design_type}{Character vector of design types to keep.}

\item{NSR}{Numeric vector of noise-to-signal ratios to keep.}

\item{replication}{Integer vector of replication indices to keep.}

\item{fold_size}{Integer vector of fold sizes to keep.}

\item{source}{Character vector of sources to keep ("function", "dataset").}

\item{failure_type}{Character vector of failure types to keep (if present).}

\item{metrics}{Character vector of metric columns to retain. If \code{NULL}
(default) all metric columns are kept.}

\item{expr}{Optional expression evaluated inside \code{obj$df} for custom
filtering, e.g. \code{expr = n_train <= 500}.}

\item{rerank}{Logical; if TRUE, recompute ranks (via \code{rank_sim_study()})
for any rank columns present. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A \code{duq_sim_study} object with filtered rows (and possibly fewer
  columns if \code{metrics} is specified).
}
\description{
Filters the rows of a simulation study while preserving class and metadata.
