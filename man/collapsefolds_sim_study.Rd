\title{Collapse Cross-Validation Folds for Simulation Study Results}
\usage{
collapsefolds_sim_study(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame from \code{run_sim_study_data()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per dataset × method combination. Metrics are aggregated across folds using fold-size weights.
}
\description{
Aggregates multiple CV folds per method × dataset into a single summary row.
}
\details{
RMSE is aggregated as the square root of the weighted average of squared RMSE terms. All other metrics are aggregated using weighted means, with weights proportional to fold size. The \code{failure_type} column is set to \code{"none"} if all folds succeeded, otherwise reports a string summary of failures (e.g., \code{"fit=1, pred=2"}).
