\title{Short Column}
\usage{
short_column(x, scale01 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Inputs of dimension (at least) 5. See below for details.}

\item{scale01}{When TRUE, inputs are expected to be given on unit interval.}
}
\description{
Dimension 5.
}
\details{
The Short Column function models a short column with uncertain material properties and dimensions sbject to uncertain loads. Y is the yield stress, M is the bending moment, P is the axial force, b is the width of the cross section, and h is the depth of the cross section. Note that sometimes M and P are given a correlated prior (correlation coefficient = 0.5).
